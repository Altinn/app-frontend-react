 * A node generator will always be rendered when a component is present in a layout, even if the component

 * Its job is to use relevant data sources to evaluate expressions in the item/component configuration,
 * and update other states needed by the component to function. We do this so that the node hierarchy
 * can always be up-to-date, and so that we can implement effects for components that run even when the
 * component is not visible/rendered.
